# It's Red and Blue, but its mostly magikarps

- Trainers are magikarps
- Rival is a magikarp
- Gym leaders are themselves, but with magikarps
- Pokemon look like magikarp, but act like their normal selves
- Last rival battle features lvl 100 magikarps
- POKé replaced by KARP
- Dialouge modified
- And some other little magikarp tweaks

Why? My brother and I were brainstorming ideas after he got an IPS modded gameboy
